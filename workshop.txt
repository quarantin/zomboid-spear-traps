description=[h1]How to build a spear trap?[/h1]
description=First you have to dig a grave. Then you need one or more spear in your inventory (up to 5 spears per grave). Finally, simply right-click the grave and you'll see a menu option:
description=[list][*][b]Add Spear to Grave[/b][/list]
description=Once a spear has been added to the trap, it can also be retrieved with the menu option:
description=[list][*][b]Remove Spear from Grave[/b][/list]

description=[b]Beware, spear traps are dangerous![/b] It's a double-edged sword. While it can kill zombies quite efficiently, [b][u]you will also die if you walk on the trap!!![/u][/b]
